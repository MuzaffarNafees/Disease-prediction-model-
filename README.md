# Multiple Disease Prediction Model Project

This repository contains predictive models developed to forecast the likelihood of three distinct diseases: Parkinson's, diabetes, and heart disease. The models were constructed utilizing machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** The primary aim of this project was to create accurate predictive models for three different diseases by leveraging machine learning algorithms.
  
- **Data Analysis:** The project involved analyzing datasets comprising information from over 1000 individuals for each disease. Relevant features were identified through comprehensive data analysis to ensure the models' accuracy.
  
- **Model Development:** Utilizing Python programming language and various tools including Spyder IDE for development, the project implemented SVM and Logistic Regression algorithms to construct predictive models for Parkinson's, diabetes, and heart disease.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The project primarily relied on Python for data analysis, model development, and deployment.
